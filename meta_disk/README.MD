# META_DISK

### V1

Currently, the Metamorphosis project is being developed with feature implementation as the top priority, so for V1 disks, it uses the already proven bboltdb and is considering developing it independently for V2 in the future. It is unknown whether V1 and V2 disks will be compatible.
