Metamorphosis is an irregular, combining modern technologies to create a unique database capable of utilizing both SQL and vector search.

- The database supports very light and fast indexes using bitmap indexing.
- The .meta file supports deflate compression, allowing data to be stored very compactly and quickly.
- Internally, it supports the hnsw algorithm, enabling fast vector searches even in large datasets.

It is currently under active development, with pgvector as a competing product.

### All documentation and descriptions will be written once the development has reached a certain stage of production readiness.
